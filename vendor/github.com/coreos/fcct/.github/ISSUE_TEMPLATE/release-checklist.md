Release checklist:

Tagging:
 - [ ] Write release notes in NEWS. Get them reviewed and merged
     - [ ] If doing a branched release, also include a PR to merge the NEWS changes into master
 - [ ] Ensure your local copy is up to date with the upstream master branch (`git@github.com:coreos/fcct.git`)
 - [ ] Ensure your working directory is clean (`git clean -fdx`)
 - [ ] Ensure you can sign commits and any yubikeys/smartcards are plugged in
 - [ ] Run `./tag_release.sh <vX.Y.z> <git commit hash>`
 - [ ] Push that tag to GitHub

Packaging:
 - [ ] Update the FCCT spec file in [Fedora](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/fedora-coreos-config-transpiler):
   - Bump the `Version`
   - Switch the `Release` back to `1.git%{shortcommit}%{?dist}`
   - Remove any patches obsoleted by the new release
   - Run `go-mods-to-bundled-provides.py | sort` while inside of the fcct directory you ran `./tag_release` from & copy output into spec file in `# Main package provides` section
   - Update change log
 - [ ] Run `spectool -g -S fedora-coreos-config-transpiler.spec`
 - [ ] Run `kinit your_fas_account@FEDORAPROJECT.ORG`
 - [ ] Run `fedpkg new-sources tarball-name`
 - [ ] PR the changes in [Fedora](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/fedora-coreos-config-transpiler)
 - [ ] Once the PR merges to master, merge master into the other relevant branches (e.g. f30) then push those
 - [ ] On each of those branches run `fedpkg build`
 - [ ] Once the builds have finished, submit them to [bodhi](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new), filling in:
   - `fedora-coreos-config-transpiler` for `Packages`
   - Selecting the build(s) that just completed, except for the rawhide one (which gets submitted automatically)
   - Writing brief release notes like "New upstream release. See release notes at `link to NEWS on GH tag`"
   - Leave `Update name` blank
   - `Type`, `Severity` and `Suggestion` can be left as `unspecified` unless it is a security release. In that case select `security` which the appropriate severity.
   - `Stable karma` and `Unstable` karma can be set to `2` and `-1`, respectively.

GitHub release:
 - [ ] Wait until the Bodhi update shows "Signed :heavy_check_mark:" in the Metadata box.

 - [ ] Wait for the ticket to be closed
 - [ ] Download the artifacts and signatures
 - [ ] Verify the signatures
 - [ ] Find the new tag in the [GitHub tag list](https://github.com/coreos/fcct/tags) and click the triple dots menu, and create a draft release for it.

 - [ ] Publish the release

Quay release:
 - [ ] Visit the [Quay tags page](https://quay.io/repository/coreos/fcct?tab=tags) and wait for a versioned tag to appear
